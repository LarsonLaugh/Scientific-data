# Scientific-data
This package includes python scripts that faciliate my data analysis and modelling. So far, it consists of two major parts: the `SciData.py` is responsible for pre-processing data into a pre-defined container; the `functions_LandauLL.py` is aimed for providing a model of three-band (three distinguishable carrier types) system.
